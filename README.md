## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Accessibility
- BEM
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- Leaflet
- Ipify
- Axios
- Parcel
- ESLint
- Netlify Serverless Functions

### What I learned

I learned a lot of things while working on this project.

The most challenging parts were how to type-check the Leaflet library and configure ESLint for usage with TypeScript and Parcel bundler.

Although, making the app accessible was also quite challenging.

### Continued development

Besides continuing to improve the accessibility of my websites, I also plan to use ESlint more in the future.
